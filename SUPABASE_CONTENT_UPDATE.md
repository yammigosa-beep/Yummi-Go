# Supabase Storage Content Management Update

## Overview
The content management system has been updated to use Supabase Storage instead of local files for content.json management.

## Changes Made

### 1. Content API Endpoint (`/api/content`)
**Before**: Read/write from local `public/content.json` file
**After**: Fetch from and save to Supabase Storage bucket

#### GET `/api/content`
- Fetches content from: `https://tmgbrmkzagzfjdjmtifo.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/content/content.json`
- Returns JSON content for the website

#### POST `/api/content` (Admin only)
- Requires `x-admin-key` header for authentication
- Saves content to Supabase Storage `content` bucket as `content.json`
- Uses POST for new files, PUT for updates

### 2. Content Hook (`useContent.tsx`)
**Before**: Fetched from `/content.json` endpoint
**After**: Fetches from `/api/content` which gets data from Supabase Storage

### 3. Admin Panel Integration
- Admin panel now edits content stored in Supabase Storage
- All content changes are saved to the cloud storage
- Content is immediately available across all deployments

## Benefits

### ✅ Centralized Content Management
- Single source of truth in Supabase Storage
- Content changes reflect across all environments instantly

### ✅ Cloud-Based Storage  
- No need to redeploy for content changes
- Content persists independently of code deployments

### ✅ Real-time Updates
- Changes made in admin panel immediately available
- No cache invalidation needed for content updates

### ✅ Scalable Architecture
- Content served from CDN via Supabase Storage
- Better performance for content delivery

## Configuration

### Supabase Storage Setup
Make sure you have a `content` bucket in your Supabase project with:
- Public access enabled for reading
- Service role access for writing

### Environment Variables Required
```env
SUPABASE_URL=https://tmgbrmkzagzfjdjmtifo.supabase.co
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE=your_service_role_key
ADMIN_API_KEY=your_admin_api_key
```

## Content URL
The content is now served from:
`https://tmgbrmkzagzfjdjmtifo.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/content/content.json`

## Usage Flow
1. **Website Load**: Frontend calls `/api/content` → fetches from Supabase Storage
2. **Admin Edit**: Admin makes changes → saves via `/api/content` POST → updates Supabase Storage
3. **Immediate Update**: Next website load gets updated content from Supabase Storage

This architecture ensures that content management is completely cloud-based and changes are immediately reflected without requiring code deployments.
